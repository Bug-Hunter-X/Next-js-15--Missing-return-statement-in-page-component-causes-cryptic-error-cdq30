# Next.js 15: Missing Return Statement Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Next.js 15 where a missing `return` statement in a page component can lead to an unhelpful error message.

## Bug Description

The `pages/about.js` file is missing a `return` statement within its default export function. This causes Next.js to throw an error, but the error message is not very clear about the underlying cause.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the Next.js development server.
4. Navigate to `/about`.

You'll observe an error in the browser console, making it difficult to identify the issue without careful examination of the code.

## Solution

Add a `return` statement to the `About` component in `pages/about.js` to fix the bug.  See `bugSolution.js` for the corrected code.

## Lessons Learned

- Always ensure your page components in Next.js return valid JSX.
- Be aware that error messages from Next.js might not always be self-explanatory, necessitating thorough code review.
